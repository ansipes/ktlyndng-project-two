                    Boycott Trump is an initiative to educate people about the different brands that endorse the Republican party and to provide alternatives to brands that endorse the Democratic party.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Political parties get most of their funding for advertisements and other important election-based events by money donated and endorsed by consumers and brands.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    This year’s election is one of the most important elections in American history due to the discrepancies left by the Trump administration.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Republican party that serves Trump is continually gaining that money through highly known brands that endorse to their party, even though they currently stand for and ignore some of the major injustices in America such as women’s rights issues and racial issues.
