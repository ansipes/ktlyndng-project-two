                  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
                  <h2>Are there any brands that don’t have any political affiliation?</h2>
                    <p>Yes! Brands such as American Apparel, Chuck E Cheese and H&M have no record of donating any money to any political party. You can access the full list here. </p>
                  <h2>Why the Democratic Party?</h2>
                  <p>We believe in the equal rights of every human being in America, from immigrants to the rich—we believe in equality. The Republican party shown through the Trump administration has done the opposite of showing equality.</p>
                  <p> The Democratic party is another step into ensuring the equal rights of everyone and it starts with better healthcare, women’s rights, a reformed justice system, etc. You can find what the Democratic party stands for here. </p>
                </p>
                  <h2>You seemed biased. 
                    Why don’t you include brands that endorse Republicans? 
                    </h2>
                    <p>We believe that not all Republicans are bad. Although this organization gives alternatives to brands that endorse the Republican party, we still lists those brands out. If you wanted to see which brands endorse which, that’s what this website is for!</p>
                    <p>We are Democrat-backed organization so we lean toward the Democratic party; however, if you would like to know more about brands that endorse the Republican party, feel free to contact us!</p>
