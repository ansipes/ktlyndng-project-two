              Yes! Brands such as American Apparel, Chuck E Cheese and H&M have
              no record of donating any money to any political party. You can
              access the full list <a href="#">here</a>.

              We believe in the equal rights of every human being in America,
              from immigrants to the rich—we believe in equality. The Republican
              party shown through the Trump administration has done the opposite
              of showing equality.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Democratic party is another step into ensuring the equal
              rights of everyone and it starts with better healthcare, women’s
              rights, a reformed justice system, etc. You can find what the
              Democratic party stands for <a href="#">here</a>.

              We believe that not all Republicans are bad. Although this
              organization gives alternatives to brands that endorse the
              Republican party, we still lists those brands out. If you wanted
              to see which brands endorse which, that’s what this website is
              for!

            <p>
              We are Democrat-backed organization so we lean toward the
              Democratic party; however, if you would like to know more about
              brands that endorse the Republican party, feel free to contact us!
